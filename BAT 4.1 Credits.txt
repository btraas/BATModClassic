This is BAT 4.1.

And it still won't run on Civ5.


This is a repair release, with a couple of fixes, but essentially it's BAT 4.0.  See the readme file for more information.



In this version of BAT, you will find:

- *NEW* The BUG Mod 4.5 - by the knowledgeable members of the BUG Team (That means not me.)	
	
- *NEW* The BUG DLL (BULL) 1.4 - Also by the knowledgeable members of the BUG Team (That also means not me.  I leave the hard work to the pros.)
- BULL includes:
	- The Unofficial Patch 1.70  (By Roamty)
	- Sentry actions
	- Global Warming Mod
	- Governor builds workers
	- Fractional Trade Routes
	- Female Great People (Ok, I helped a little with BULL.)
	- Anything else that EF and Ruff have thrown in and not told me about.

•Lemon's Movie Mod by Lemon Merchant, with slices, dices, and interpolations of music from Cybrxkhan's Diplomacy Music Packs.  Used with his gracious permission.
	A note about the movie mod:
	[SPOILER] These are little movies for the Shrines and National Wonders.  The available ones for download were very good, but so darn long, and I felt that they broke the flow of the game.  I created new ones with an individual length of 15 seconds each, with new music, so that they would be a little less obtrusive.  The music has also had the volume leveled out so that it's closer to the volume levels in the game. [/SPOILER]
[/SPOILER]

[/SPOILER]

As always, if you find errors or issues, please post them (constructively please) in the BAT Errata thread.


Known Errata: (To be addressed in a patch)

1. Some of the buttons are still blurry at some resolutions.
2. Some buttons are wrong for the type of unit shown.
3. The Persian Musketman is headless.  Something in Varietas Delectat is causing this and I'm trying to fix it.
4. There is an error in the flag hover.  BULL says it's still 1.3, when in fact it is version 1.4.
