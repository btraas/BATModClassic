BAT 4.1 Readme File

This is a repair release, and is identical to BAT 4.0, with the exception that there are no extra animals, and the ocean water has been restored to blue after some user concerns.

Fixes:

- Removed extra animals.  Only the standard BTS animals are available now.
- Altered Nitram15's Water Mod 2.0 to have Blue Marble water.
- Repaired bug where peaks would show different art when the grid was selected.
