		<English>[TAB]The Wright Brothers corrected earlier mistakes in calculations regarding drag and lift, though they missed the effect of Reynolds number (known since 1883), which would have given them an even bigger advantage. Their testing and calculating produced a third glider design, which they flew in 1902. It performed far better than the previous models. In the end, by establishing their rigorous system of designing, wind-tunnel testing of models and flight testing of full-size prototypes, the Wrights not only built a working aircraft but also helped advance the modern science of aeronautical engineering.</English>

Ihre Berechnungen und Versuche führten zu einem dritten Gleiterdesign, das sie 1902 flogen mit deutlich besseren Ergebnissen als mit Vormodellen. Schließlich, indem sie ihr System des Entwerfens, der Windkanäl-Versuche und der Erprobung von Prototypen in voller Größe umsetzten, bauten die Wrights nicht nur voll funktionstüchtige Flugzeuge, sondern halfen auch die Theorie der modernen Luftfahrt weiter zu entwickeln.</German>

		<English>[TAB]Multiple expansion engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple and quadruple expansion engines respectively. These engines use a series of double-acting cylinders of progressively increasing diameter and/or stroke and hence volume. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into three or four, as appropriate, equal portions for each expansion stage. As with the double expansion engine, where space is at a premium, two smaller cylinders of a large sum volume may be used for the low pressure stage. Multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline, but various other formations were used.</English>

Questi motori usano una serie di cilindri a due tempi di diametro e/o corsa e volume progressivamente più grandi. Questi cilindri sono disegnati per dividere il lavoro in tre o quattro partizioni, in base all'uso, uguali per ogni fase di espansione. Così come il motore ad espansione doppia, dove è privilegiato lo spazio, due cilindri più piccoli con un ampio volume complessivo possono essere usati per le fasi a bassa pressione.

		<English>[TAB]A Diesel engine is an internal combustion engine which operates using the Diesel cycle. German engineer Rudolf Diesel invented it in 1892, basing it on the hot bulb engine. He received a patent for it on February 23, 1893. The Diesel cycle uses compression ignition: the fuel ignites upon being injected into the highly compressed air in the combustion chamber. By contrast, petrol engines utilize the Otto cycle, in which fuel and air are typically mixed before entering the combustion chamber. The mixture is then ignited by a spark plug. Compression ignition is generally considered undesirable in Otto cycle engines (see engine knocking).</English>

For a given normal to the surface of the armour, its plate thickness, increasing armour slope improves the armour's level of protection by increasing the thickness measured on a horizontal plane, while for a given area density of the armour the protection can be either increased or reduced by other sloping effects, depending on the armour materials used and the qualities of the projectile hitting it. The increased protection caused by increasing the slope while keeping the plate thickness constant, is due to a proportional increase of area density and thus mass, and thus offers no weight benefit.

Therefore the other possible effects of sloping, such as deflection, deforming and ricochet of a projectile, have been the reasons to apply sloped armour in armoured vehicles design.</Hungarian>

Some light tanks are able to move over land rapidly compared to heavier tanks and are maneuverable through obstacles such as jungle thickets, while maintaining lethality against enemy infantry. The Imperial Japanese Army exploited this ability of their light tanks during the Battle of Malaya.

		<Spanish>[TAB]Light tanks tend to be smaller, faster, and lighter vehicles, and cheaper to produce. The weight of a 'light' tank increased markedly during WWII. For example, the M24 Chaffee was a purpose-built light tank of late WWII, but weighed more than the Panzer III, a mainstay medium tank from 1939-43 but obsolete at the time the Chaffee was introduced. Some light tanks are able to move over land rapidly compared to heavier tanks and are maneuverable through obstacles such as jungle thickets, while maintaining lethality against enemy infantry.

		<German>[TAB]Der Dreadnought war im 20. Jahrhundert die überlegene Schlachtschiffklasse. Das Modell entwickelte sich aus der revolutionären HMS Dreadnought von 1906 und unterschied sich von vorherigen Schlachtschiffen, bekannt als Prä-Dreadnoughts, durch ihre Bewaffnung aus großen Geschützen. Wenige Jahre nach der Indienststellung der HMS Dreadnought, bauten bereits sehr viele Flotten Schiffe, die durch ihr Design inspiriert waren. Das Produkt technischer Überlegenheit der Britten und der Willenskraft von Admiral Jackie Fisher kam nicht aus heiterem Himmel. Das Konzept eines Schiffes mit derart schwerer Bewaffnung ging bereits seit einigen Jahren um, und die Japaner bauten bereits 1904 eins. Das Auftauchen der Dreadnoughts verursachte ein Wettrüsten, vor allem zwischen Großbritanien und Deutschland, jedoch mit weltweiten Einflüssen, und diese neue Schiffsklasse wurde zum Statussymbol der Macht vieler Nationen. (A.d.Ü.: Das Wort "dreadnought" wird im Deutschen normalerweise genauso wie "battleship" mit "Schlachtschiff" übersetzt. Um eine Unterscheidung zu ermöglichen, wird "Dreadnought" nicht übersetzt.)</German>

		<English>[TAB]A pre-dreadnought battleship is an ocean-going battleship of a type built between the mid-1890s and 1905. Pre-dreadnoughts replaced the ironclad battleship of the 1870s and 1880s. Built from steel, and protected by hardened steel armour, pre-dreadnought battleships carried a main battery of very heavy guns in turrets supported by one or more secondary batteries of lighter weapons. They were propelled by coal-powered triple-expansion steam engines. In the 1890s, navies worldwide started to build battleships to a common designin contrast to the chaotic development of ironclad warships in preceding decades, dozens of ships worldwide essentially followed the design of the British Majestic. The similar appearance of the battleships of the 1890s was underlined by the increasing number of ships being built. New naval powers like Germany, Japan and the USA began to establish themselves with fleets of pre-dreadnought battleships, while the navies of Britain, France and Russia expanded to meet the threat. The main clashes of pre-dreadnought fleets came during the Russo-Japanese War of 19045.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Ein Prä-Dreadnought Schlachtschiff ist ein seetüchtiges Schlachtschiff, wie es zwischen 1890 und 1905 gebaut wurde. Prä-Dreadnoughts ersetzten die gepanzerten Schlachtschiffe der 1870er und 80er. Mit einem Rumpf und einer Panzerung aus Stahl trugen Prä-Dreadnought Schlachtschiffe eine Hauptbatterie aus schweren Geschützen in Türmen unterstützt aus einer oder mehreres sekundären Batterien mit leichteren Geschützen. Sie wurden durch Kohlegetrieben Dreifachexpansions-Dampfmotoren angetrieben. In den 1890ern begannen Flotten weltweit Schlachtschiffe einheitlich zu bauen im Gegensatz zu dem Durcheinander an Entwürfen bei Panzerschiffen zuvor. So wurden zum Beispiel Dutzende Schiffe weltweit der brittischen Majestic nachempfunden. Die Ähnlichkeit im Aussehen von Schlachtschiffen in den 1890ern wurde durch die gestiegene Produktionszahl unterstrichen. Aufstrebende Seemächte wie Deutschland, Japan und die USA etablierten sich durch Flotten aus Prä-Dreadnoughts, während die Flotten Großbritaniens, Frankreichs und Rußland expandierten, um dieser Bedrohung zu begegnen. Die größten Kampfhandlungen zwischen Prä-Dreadnoughts gab es im Krieg zwischen Rußland und Japan 1904-05. (A.d.Ü.: Der Prä-Dreadnought ist eigentlich auch ein Schlachtschiff älteren Designs.)</German>

		<English>[TAB]The word fighter was first used to describe a two seater aircraft, with sufficient lift to carry a machine gun and its operator as well as the pilot. The first such fighters belonged to the gunbus series of experimental gun carriers of the Vickers company which culminated in the Vickers F.B.5 Gunbus of 1914. The main drawback of this type of aircraft was its lack of speed. It was quickly realised that an aircraft intended to destroy its kind in the air needed at least to be fast enough to catch its quarry. Fortunately another type of military aircraft already existed, which was to form the basis for an effective "fighter" in the modern sense of the word. It was based on the small fast aircraft developed before the war for such air races as the Gordon Bennett and Schneider trophies. The military scout aeroplane was not initially expected to be able to carry serious armament, but to rely on its speed to be able to reach the location it was required to scout or reconnoitre and return quickly to report  all the time making a difficult target for AA artillery or enemy gun-carrying aircraft. British scout aircraft in this sense included the Sopwith Tabloid and Bristol Scout  French equivalents included the light, fast Morane-Saulnier N.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Ursprünglich verstand man unter dem Begriff Jäger ein Flugzeug mit zwei Mann Besatzung, dem Piloten und einem Bordschützen, der das Bordmaschinengewehr bediente. Die ersten Jäger dieser Art gehöhrte zu der 'Gunbus' Reihe der Vicker-Werke mit verschiedenen experimentellen Bewaffnungen, was 1914 zur Entwicklung des Vickers F.B.5 Gunbus führte. Der Hauptnachteil dieser Maschinen war die geringe Geschwindigkeit. Schnell wurde klar, dass ein Flugzeug, das in der Lage sein soll ein vergleichbares in der Luft zu zerstören, wenigstens schnell genug sein muß, seine Beute zu stellen. Zum Glück existierte bereits ein anderer Flugzeugtyp, der zur Basis eines effektiveren Jägers im heutigem Sinne wurde. Dabei handelte es sich um ein vor dem Krieg entworfenes kleines Flugzeug, ursprünglich für Luftrennen gedacht. Vom militärischen Aufklärungsflugzeug wurde ursprünglich nicht erwartet, ernsthafte Bewaffnung zu tragen, sondern es sollte aufgrund von Geschwindigkeit Aufklärungsarbeit leisten, während es ein schweres Ziel für Luftabwehr oder Flugzeuge darstellte. Brittische Aufklärungsflugzeuge waren zum Beispiel der Soqwith Tabloid und der Bristol Scout, französische verglkeichbare Aufkläreren waren zum Beispiel die leichten, schnellen Morane-Saulnier N.</German>

		<English>[TAB]A tracked fighting vehicle was proposed in 1912 by Australian engineer L. E. de Mole. It was one of the earliest practical designs offered to the British War Office. He was notified in June 1913 that his idea had been rejected, though only some of his drawings were returned. He resisted urging from friends to sell the design to the German consul in Perth. The stalemate on the Western Front later prompted the British Army to begin research into a self-propelled vehicle which could cross trenches, crush barbed wire, and be impervious to machine-gun fire. Originally, tanks were part of the British Navy, which would train and provide all tank personnel, and were considered "landships". The First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, sponsored the Landships Committee, which created the first successful prototype tank, 'Little Willie', in September 1915. The vehicles were colloquially referred to as water carriers, later shortened to tanks, to preserve secrecy; the name became official in December 1915. The first tank to engage in battle was D1, a British Mark I, during the Battle of Flers-Courcellette (part of the Battle of the Somme), on 15 September 1916, one of two to breach German lines and reach Flers, but was knocked out by friendly fire. One of these two also mistakenly machinegunned the 9th Norfolks, who were preparing to attack. The French developed the Schneider CA1 working from Holt caterpillar tractors, and first used it on 16 April 1917. The first successful use of massed tanks in combat occurred at Cambrai on 20 November 1917. Tanks were also used to great effect in the Battle of Amiens, when Allied forces were able to break through entrenched German position due to armoured support.</English>

Tank destroyers are used primarily to provide anti-tank support in combat operations but do not fit all the criteria of a tank. They may mount a high-velocity anti-tank gun but have an open turret, no turret at all or run on wheels instead of tracks.

Tank destroyers cannot fulfil the many roles of tanks; they are much less flexible, and usually lack a strong anti-infantry capability.

However, as a result of having no turret and fewer parts, tank destroyers are much less expensive to manufacture.

Panzer, Artillerie und Infiltrationstaktiken ermöglichten, dass die feindlichen Linien durchbrochen werden konnten, aber 1918 verliefen sich fast alle Offensiven innerhalb weniger Tage. Die angreifenden Infanteristen waren schnell erschöpft und Artillerie und Nachschub konnten nicht schnell genug hinterher geschafft werden, um den Druck auf den sich neu gruppierenden Gegner aufrecht zu erhalten. Kavallerie war für den Einsatz auf den meisten europäischen Kriegsschauplätzen zu verwundbar, auch wenn viele Armeen sie weiterhin einsetzten. Motorisierte Infanterie war schnell, jedoch benötigten die LKWs ein gutes Straßennetz oder vollkommen offenes Gelände.

Heutzutage wird der Begriff 'Leichte' Infanterie nicht mehr über die Ausrüstung definiert sondern über Hilfsfahrzeuge. Schwere Infanterie nutz schwere gepanzerte Kampffahrzeuge, während Leichte Infanterie für gewöhnlich tatsächlich zu Fuß unterwegs ist, und deswegen größere Mengen Munition, Versorgungsgüter und Ausrüstungen tragen muß. Dadurch hat Leichte Infanterie zwangläufig eine geringere Feuerkraft.

Light infantry are used where it would not be possible, desirable or cost effective to deploy AFVs and have the advantage that they can be deployed around the world in days (instead of the weeks it would takes for a mechanized infantry units).</Hungarian>

		<English>[TAB]The Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) contract was a demonstration and validation program undertaken by the United States Air Force to develop a next-generation air superiority fighter to counter emerging worldwide threats, including development and proliferation of Soviet-era Su-27 'Flanker' type fighter aircraft. In 1981, USAF developed a requirement for a new air superiority fighter intended to replace the capability of the F-15 Eagle. It was envisaged that the ATF would incorporate emerging technologies including advanced alloys and composite material, advanced fly-by-wire flight control systems, higher power propulsion systems, and low-observable, or stealth technology. Following a hard-fought fly-off competition, in August 1991 the YF-22 was declared the winner and the Lockheed team was awarded the contract to develop and build the Advanced Tactical Fighter. The Northrop design was later considered by the company for modification as a bomber but such proposals have not come to fruition. The production version of the aircraft, the F-22 Raptor was unveiled on April 9, 1997, at Lockheed-Georgia Co., Marietta, Georgia, and conducted its first flight on September 7, 1997. The Raptor achieved initial operational capability on December 15, 2005.</English>

Dabei muß er sich mit der russischen Su-27 'Flanker' messen. 1981 bestimmte die US Luftwaffe Richtlinien, die ein Nachfolger für die F-15 erfüllen muß. Diese beinhalteten unter anderem: Verbesserte Verbundstoffe und Aluminiumlegierungen, fortschrittliche Steuerungssysteme, höhere Schubleistung, verringerte Sichtbarkeit und Stealth-Technologie. In einem Kopf-an-Kopf-Rennen setzte sich im August 1991 die YF-22 durch und Lockhead bekam den Zuschlag für den ATF. Seit 1997 ist der F-22 'Raptor' im Dienst.</German>

		<English>[TAB]The second generation (of jet fighters, 1953-60) describes the integration of many new technologies to greatly improve the fighting capability of the jet fighter. The introduction of guided missiles such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow moved combat to beyond visual range (though it often devolved into dogfights in visual range), necessitating the standardization of radar to acquire targets. Designers experimented with a variety of aeronautical innovations, such as the swept wing, delta wing, variable-geometry wings, and area ruled fuselages. With the aid of swept wing, these were the first production aircraft to break the sound barrier. The third generation (1960-1970) is marked by maturity in the innovations introduced in the first generation. As this aeronautical development approached maturity, growth in combat capability grew via the introduction of improved missiles, radar, and other avionics. Most significantly, as a result of combat experience with guided missiles, designers conceded that combat could and would degenerate into close dogfights. Guns again became standard, and maneuverability was once again a priority.</English>

		<English>[TAB]A helicopter is an aircraft that is lifted and propelled by one or more horizontal rotors, each rotor consisting of two or more rotor blades. Helicopters are classified as rotorcraft or rotary-wing aircraft to distinguish them from fixed-wing aircraft because the helicopter derives its source of lift from the rotor blades rotating around a mast. The word 'helicopter' is adapted from the French hélicoptere, coined by Gustave de Ponton d'Amecourt in 1861. It is linked to the Greek words helix/helik- = "spiral" or "turning" and pteron = "wing".</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Galleass is a large, fast, heavily armed three-masted Mediterranean galley with a forecastle and aftcastle from the 16th and 17th centuries. As converted for military use they were higher and larger than regular ("light") galleys. They had as many as thirty-two oars, each worked by up to 5 men. Much effort was made in Venice to make these galleasses as fast as they could be so they could compete with regular galleys. The gun-deck usually ran over the rowers' heads, although pictures showing the opposite arrangement exist. Galleasses usually carried more sails than true galleys, and were far deadlier; a galley caught broadside lay all but helpless, but coming broadside to a galleass, as with a ship of the line, merely exposed an attacker to her gunfire. The galleass exemplified an intermediate type between the galley and the true man-of-war. Relatively few galleasses were built, one disadvantage was that, being more reliant on sails, their position at the front of the galley line at the start of a battle could not be guaranteed, but they featured at the Battle of Lepanto (7 October 1571), their firepower helping to win victory for the Christian fleet, and some sufficiently seaworthy galleasses accompanied the Spanish Armada in 1588 (e.g. La Girona). In the Mediterranean, with its shallower waters, less dangerous weather and fickle winds, galleasses and galleys alike continued in use, particularly in Venice and Turkey, long after they became regarded as obsolete elsewhere. Later, "round ships" and galleasses were replaced by galleons and ships of the line which originated in northern Europe.</English>

		<English>[TAB]In April 1917, the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) introduced the Sopwith Triplane. The Sopwith swiftly proved itself superior to the Albatros and Halberstadt scouts then in use by the German Air Service. In response, the Idflieg immediately solicited designs for new triplane scouts. No fewer than 11 German aircraft manufacturers, including Albatros, Pfalz, AEG, DFW, Schütte-Lanz, and Euler, responded with triplane prototypes. Most showed little promise, though limited production of the Pfalz Dr. I was undertaken.The Fokker works responded with the V.3, a small, rotary-powered triplane with a tubular-steel frame fuselage and thick cantilever wings. Initial tests revealed deficiencies in the V.3, particularly regarding control forces. Instead of submitting the V.3 for a type test, Fokker produced a revised prototype designated V.4. The most notable changes were the introduction of horn-balanced ailerons and elevators, as well as longer-span wings. The V.4 also featured interplane struts, which were not necessary from a structural standpoint, but which minimized wing flexing.The V.4 proved superior to the triplane prototypes submitted by the other manufacturers. After a type test, Idflieg issued an immediate production order.</English>
